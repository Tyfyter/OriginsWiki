				The <b>Brine Pool</b> isn't like most other brine pools in Terraria, this one has a lengthy history dating back to <a is="a-link">early civilization</a>.
				This one was cursed by the <a is="a-link">Lost Crone</a> in an attempt to keep the <a is="a-link">Crown Jewel</a> away from the wrong hands.
				With her curse in effect for a few thousands years, creatures have evolved and adapted to its unusually harsh conditions making it even more dangerous as she forsaw.
				The dangers of the Brine Pool did not scare the Lost Diver, who was too focused on his success and was mysteriously wiped from history.
				The Lost Diver is known as "the hero with no name" by any who know of his story.

I curse you such that any daring divers of your waters are poisoned forever. I curse you for all light to be drowned out. Keep this bloodstained wasteland away from those who manipulate with the curses I've brought onto you.`},

Some of his equipment looks like he was ready to pick a fight with something much larger than him.<br> ???: I agree, but I really wonder why he was down here to begin with. There's nothing but scary fish monsters here!`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Baryte</a>`, Whisper:`???: No. There was something here that I'd heard about from a guy I met. Apparently, this brine pool in particular was cursed in order to protect some kind of artifact.<br> ???: Really?<br> ???: Yeah, and it was supposedly for "Terraria's strongest warrior". He must've thought he was the stuff coming all the way down here for it.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Boat Rocker</a>`, Whisper:`???: One shot, slam it down. Two shots, wave it all around. Three shots, blunt side for the pound. Four shots, kick the ground. Five, the aim is sound. What brings yah, Penny?<br> Penny: I came to bring you a gift. These beads are fitting for an adventurous soul such as yourself.<br> ???: Oh...<br> Penny: They're magic in case you're wondering~<br> ???: Oh heck yeah!`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Faith Beads</a>`, Whisper:`Penny: Now take off your suit.<br> ???: What?! I'm going to die if I do that!<br> Penny: Not with those beads around your neck. They're faith beads, old relics created by our ancestors to be blessed by the ocean gods before we could breathe underwater. Now they're just fancy hierlooms.<br> ???: Woah, this feels awesome!`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Lost Picture Frame</a>`, Whisper:`A picture of the sunset we used to adore all the time together. It was unfortunate, letting her go that day. Whenever I needed that fire in my heart, I thought of her.`},

				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Mildew Carrion</a>`, Whisper:`The hero with no name, he was not to blame. Wicked animals making the man their toy, when he was only just a boy. Lost his family at such young age, and his merfolk girlfriend filled him with much rage. Handled himself well and broke away, found new things to conquer day-by-day. Before long his lust for adventure came, and so did he below the brine never the same.`}

				<h3>The Tale of a Hero With No Name</h3>
				<p>He was known as the Lost Diver before he was put out of his misery from the abominable mildew that puppeted his finely-preserved body. Some folks remembered and passed down knowledge of this hero from stories of their time, but none of which that would give him a definite name. A tragedy too, the boy only wanted to be remembered for his noble service to Terraria but he lost it all in his trek to obtain the Crown Jewel below the brine. The diverman handled many of Terraria's worst aquatic foes with his trusty, copper-laden harpoon gun. He was just short of a hero because of one fatal flaw: he was simply not humble enough. All of the young man’s ambitions left to gray out with time like the Defiled; the Crown Jewel killed him because he was deemed unworthy for its power. It is unknown if the crystal is the reason why we all forgot the lad's name, but it is known that, as pretentious as he may've been, he was a hero who saved many lives and be rid of many horrible sea monsters. He will be remembered forever as “the hero with no name”.</p>

				<h3>Old Brine Rock's entry</h3>
				<p>
					The Lost Crone is narrating her in the process of cursing the Brine Pool.
					She is describing the nature of her curse and mentions a "bloodstained wasteland" that needs to be kept away from anymore "manipulators".
					The Lost Crone is known to be a neutral force in the story of Terraria and has seen the harmful things that many heroes in her time have done.
				</p>

				<h3>Torpedo Tube's entry</h3>
				<p>
					Two explorers are discovering the Lost Diver's gear left in the Brine Pool and commenting on him.
					The Lost Diver/hero with no name seems to be a professional at what they do with their advanced equipment.
				</p>

				<h3>Baryte's entry</h3>
				<p>
					The Crown Jewel, the artifact in question, in legend is described as an artifact capable of granting a worthy hero with great power.
					Specifically, it allows a hero the ability to absorb the spirits of powerful monsters inhabiting Terraria, making themselves stronger.
					This could suggest a reason behind it being so desireable to the Lost Diver.
				</p>

				<h3>Lost Diver's entry</h3>
				<p>
					The Lost Diver/hero with no name was a young hero who was made into a mess because of how society treated him as a tool.
					He had no family background growing up and developed a love interest with a siren known as "Penny", but it didn't work out because of the Lost Diver's craving for adventure.
					He developed a sadness and anger towards himself for being love-blind, but he found solace in the acts of heroism he committed.
					In the end, it was not enough as he sustained too many injuries from his quest to retrieve the Crown Jewel at the bottom of the Brine Pool and lost his will to live after finally coming to reality with his mistakes.
					Because of his lack of heart or personality, his heroic deeds were remembered but his name was forgotten.

				<p>
					The Brine Pool started as a cave in the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Jungle">Jungle</a> that flooded overtime and had dead plant and animal matter fall into it.
					Overtime the water started to solidify the rock and dirt encompassing the cave, which created a permanent rock bed for the cave.
					As time went on geothermal activity in the cave resulted in the formation of the hydrothermal vents, which lead to the generation of brine in the cave.
				</p>

				<p>
					A long while after its formation, the Lost Crone stumbled across the brine pool in search for a place to hide the Crown Jewel away.
					She cursed it with dark magic making it as deadly as possible to any travelers.
					The curse worked for a long time until the Lost Diver heard about the Crown Jewel from legends and attempted to claim it.
					He had reached the Crown Jewel at the bottom of the Brine Pool, but died from injuries he sustained from fighting the extremophile inhabitants of the Pool.
					With time, mildew found its way into his suit and managed to take over his perfectly-preserved body (from the lack of oxygen in the Brine Pool).

				<p>
					The Terrarian finds the <a is="a-link">Lost Picture Frame</a> and is curious about its strange presence.
					Tampering with it, the Terrarian awakens the Lost Diver from its slumber as it rises from the ground and approaches them.
					The Terrarian fights the Lost Diver, eventually exposing the Mildew Carrion.
					After defeating the Mildew Carrion, the Crown Jewel drops from it for the Terrarian to absorb.
				</p>

				<p>
					Not much happens as a result of any of this other than the Terrarian growing more powerful as they inherit the ability to absorb the spirits of powerful enemies.
