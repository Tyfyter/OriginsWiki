			<p>
				The <b>Cleansing Station</b> is a functional <a is="a-link">furniture</a> item that is sold by the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a> after completing her 'Woodsprite Steps' <a is="a-link" href="Quests.html">quest</a>.
				When holding down the <b>Interact</b> key nearby, it will rapidly deplete all <a is="a-link">Assimilation</a> the player has accrued.
				When holding a <a is="a-link">Mojo Flask</a> and interacting with the Cleansing Station, it will also refill it back to the five charges it started with.
				It is one of the three only sources of assimilation management currently available.
			</p>

			<p>
				Despite being able to be placed in <a is="a-link">evil biomes</a>, it will not cleanse the player or refill any Mojo Flasks while inside of it.
				The player must place the Cleansing Station far enough away from the evil biome in order to use it.
