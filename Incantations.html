				<b>Incantations</b> are a new type of <a is="a-link" href="Summon_Weapons.html">summon weapon</a> that fire a projectile that which can be controlled by pressing and holding down the <b>Attack</b> button.
				Some incantations lack this ability to be controlled.
				Incantations were introduced to provide a medium between summons and <a is="a-link">whips</a>, filling the role as both as they are also able to tag struck enemies like whips.
