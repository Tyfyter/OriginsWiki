				The <b>Missing File</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Magic_Weapons.html">magic weapon</a> found in <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Dungeon_Chest.html">Defiled Dungeon Chests</a>.
				Selecting it in the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hotbar">hotbar</a> while enemies are nearby causes several icons to pop up for the player to click on with the cursor.

				When the wrong icon is selected, it does nothing and changes the icons that are on screen.
