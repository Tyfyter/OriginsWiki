				The <b>Amoebeye</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> that occasionally spawns in the <a is="a-link">Riven Hive</a>.
				It will slowly approach the player from the edge of the screen and will have considerable <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense">defense</a> until it enters its "enraged" state.
				Once the player draws near, the Amoebeye will fire a bubble at the player in an attempt to capture them that instills <a is="a-link" href="Assimilation.html">Riven Assimilation</a> on them until it disappears.
				The Amoebeye will then enter its enraged state and lower its defense, charging at the player for a swift kill.
				It can also be aggroed if its bubble is destroyed, so exercise caution when attempting to circumvent your capture.

					 - The Amoebeye moves very slowly towards the player when it is not aggroed.
					The greatest way to eliminate them is by using weapons with high base damage and/or <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense#Armor_penetration">armor penetration</a>.
					If none of your weapons are strong enough to attack it, simply avoid it by out manuevering it.

					 - The <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bestiary">Bestiary</a> entry for the Amoebeye: "Amoebeyes are the next evolutionary step for Riven Protoforms ever since the Riven's expansion. They safeguard the hives to eliminate any threats to the ecosystem."
