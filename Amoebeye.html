				The <b>Amoebeye</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Enemies.html">enemy</a> that occasionally spawns in the <a is="a-link">Riven Hive</a>.
				It will slowly approach the player from the edge of the screen and will have considerable <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense">defense</a> until it enters its "enraged" state.
				Once the player draws near, the Amoebeye will fire a bubble at the player in an attempt to capture them that instills <a is="a-link" href="Assimilation.html">Riven Assimilation</a> on them until it disappears.
				The Amoebeye will then enter its enraged state and lower its defense, charging at the player for a swift kill.
				It can also be aggroed if its bubble is destroyed, so exercise caution when attempting to circumvent your capture.

					 - The Amoebeye moves very slowly towards the player when it is not aggroed.
					The greatest way to eliminate them is by using weapons with high base damage and/or <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Defense#Armor_penetration">armor penetration</a>.
					If none of your weapons are strong enough to attack it, simply avoid it by out manuevering it.

					 - Upon defeating an Amoebeye once, the following will appear in the <a is="a-link">Journal</a>:

					"<i>And, interestingly-enough, these organisms often evolve in rapid and unpredictable ways. Those amoebeyes we saw patrolling the Hive were actually once protoforms. This place and the Amoeba itself are purely natural beings surviving in this world.</i>"<br>
