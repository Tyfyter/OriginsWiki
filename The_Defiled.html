				<b>The Defiled</b> as a whole is an alien entity the size of the world.
				It has adapted to its own way of life that further alienates it from everything else in the world.
				The Defiled entity can be best described as a physical manifestation of an egregore of hosts who warped to its will, sacrificing their autonomy for endless survival.
				The caveats go further when the individual details are explained further.

				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Infusion</a>`, Whisper:`We wanted only to be left alone, or to be understood. Perhaps it was too hard them understanding something they never gave enough time to begin. They still pried wicked magic into our bodies and failed. Only succeeding when they brought the most elder to handle us.`},
				{Object:`<a is="a-link" image="$fromStats">Dismay</a>`, Whisper:`She was not of their kin, the one who could take us.

				<h3>Compositional</h3>
				<p>
					<b>Black Bile</b> is a waste by-product generated when Defiled matter (what the chunks are made of) and energy are created by <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Relay.html">Defiled Relays</a>.
					Throughout the game black bile undergoes a rapid chemical property change after defeating the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Wall_of_Flesh">Wall of Flesh</a> as the entity grows more worried about the Terrarian.
					It shifts from being a black heavy-gas that absorbs all light to a mulberry-colored semi-solid, which only happens because black bile desublimates from it getting colder in the Wastelands.
					Black Bile in either state acts as a filler material for defiled objects and means of assimilating new hosts.
					Just touching black bile significantly increases the chances of cancer in beings and influences their likelihood of being depressed, making it harder for them to resist the Defiled Will.
					Black Bile also seems to be some kind of excrement containing the negative emotions/influence of the Defiled egregore.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Defiled chunks</b> or simply <b>chunks</b> are pieces that make up all Defiled machinations which have a purpose beyond just being a structural component.
					Being made out of a compound created by the entity itself, they also magically store information in the form of memories of the host they were once a part of.
					They are also conductive to electricity and magnetic so the Defiled can operate and control their constructs properly.
					Chunks are regularly transferred across different Defiled objects as part of its means of survival (transfering energy, rebuilding, etc.), which often results in the loss of memories that once belonged to that host.
					This can also be seen as a way for the Defiled to automate the communication process and enable the entity to learn incredibly fast as experiences are shared.
					The <a is="a-link">Tale of Arabel</a> talks about her rare experience about being half-assimilated to the Defiled and how she is on a quest to recover lost memories of her son who passed.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Defiled mana</b> is a form of mana the Defiled uses to perform its magic.
					It is used to generate Defiled matter creating black bile, Defiled matter and energy in the form of electricity stored in the chunks.
					Defiled mana can only be generated when mana is stolen from hosts and is converted.
					When a host is in the process of being assimilated by the Defiled, it will have its mana converted into Defiled mana.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Strange String</b>, as implied by its tooltip, is the nervous system of the original host or a surrogate host.
					The nervous system, including the host's brain, is normally kept in-tact by the Defiled as it is used for communication and control over them.
					Since the nervous system relies on electrical signals received by incoming chunks or a direct nerve impulse, and when a host is doused with high amounts of electricity, it fries their nerves; often making them unable to respond.
					Some host's nervous systems are instead used to build the Defiled's neural infrastructure such as the underground neural network or the monoliths and relays it builds to broadcast nerve impulses.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Nerve impulses</b> are signals manifested using Defiled mana primarily used for communication "wirelessly" across different disconnected Defiled constructs.
					They are generally handled by larger bodies to prevent an overload in the nervous circuitry.
				</p>

				<h3>Other</h3>
				<p>
					The <b>Defiled Will</b> is a doctrine used by the Defiled entity to assimilate and convince hosts of their offering.
					The Defiled Will is essentially a promise to a competent thinker that the Defiled way of life can ensure their endless existence with the sacrifice of their autonomy, failing to mention any other caveats.

				<summary>History<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					The Defiled entity originally arrived to the world of Terraria from a "dimensional rift" with no recollection of anything, relying solely on its instincts to survive.
					It began to consume things and the world itself, spreading at a fast rate before it began to cause problems for the ancient settlers of the world and the <a is="a-link">Dryad Clan</a>.
					A long-lasting war known as the "Defiled War" (which is how they got their name) was waged on the Defiled where they held out against weapons and magic alike, rapidly evolving and learning more about their adversaries and how to compose their chunks.
					The Defiled won the war with several of their most primitive creations still standing, which can be found in-game as the Ancient Defiled Cyclops and <a is="a-link">Ancient Defiled Phantom</a>.
					However, they were fooled by the <a is="a-link">Lost Crone</a> who forsaw the arrival of the Defiled and promised them "endless odds".
					She sacrificed herself by damning herself to <a is="a-link">the Dusk</a> with the Defiled wanting to redeem herself, but it had been in vain.
				</p>

				<p>
					Long after the events of the <a is="a-link">Dark Age</a>, an imbalance in the Terraria world prompted the Defiled to be relieved from their purgatory in the Dusk, given the rite of passage as a surrogate evil.
					Awoken from their dormancy, they began to spread across the world discovering that the resistance they experienced before was now absent.
					The Defiled began to get lazy and reach a period of minimal progress until <a is="a-link">the Terrarian</a> was summoned by the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a>.
				</p>
			</details>

			<details class="section" id="In-game events" open>
				<summary>In-game events<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					The Defiled has two possible timelines depending on what the player decides to do.
					Both of these are separately explained below.
				</p>

				<h3>Egregocide Route</h3>
				<p>
					The Terrarian battles through monsters and works with the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a> to cleanse the Defiled, but with progress being minimal until the <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Heart.html">Defiled Hearts</a> are destroyed.
					Despite the Defiled's best efforts to deny the Terrarian, all of their hearts get destroyed and the Defiled egregore with it.
					All connections between the aimless Defiled entities are lost, which ceases synchrony, black bile generation and nerve impulse communications.
					Without black bile to act as a coping mechanism for the now-solitary Defiled creatures many of them fall into panic, hysteria, ferality or a combination of the three.
					As the concentration of black bile in the atmosphere is reduced, the absorption of colors from sunlight wanes resulting in everything donning a yellow-orange coloration.
					As an added consequence of all this, all Defiled metabolic activity has ceased such that chunks can no longer be regenerated from stolen mana, leaving the only way for entities to maintain themselves is to canninbalize each other.
				</p>

				<h3><a is="a-link">Mimic Route</a></h3>
				<p>
					Instead of heeding the Dryad's warnings, the Terrarian instead decides to keep the entity alive.
					The Terraria world responds by nearly killing the Terrarian off for good until the Defiled saves them.
					The Defiled, instead of stripping away their autonomy and warping them like everything else, entrusts the Terrarian by merging with them to grant many powerful abilities, control over all of the Defiled and the ability to respawn again.
				</p>

				<summary>Trivia<span class="divider"></span></summary>
				<p>
					 - "Egregocide" is a made-up word derived from the word "<a is="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore#:~:text=An%20egregore%20(also%20spelled%20egregor,a%20distinct%20group%20of%20individuals.">egregore</a>" and the suffix "-cide".
					An egregore is a collective concious formed from collective thought and emotions of a group of people.<br>
					 - The "dimensional rift" the Defiled comes from is a direct reference to its origin from the Startropic Adventures game.
					 In Startropic Adventures, the Defiled is solely known as "Hauai" and maintains their likeness from that game.
