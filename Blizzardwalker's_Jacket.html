				The <b>Blizzardwalker's Jacket</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Accessories.html">accessory</a> that has a 1/4 (25%) chance to be dropped by <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Deerclops">Deerclops</a> in <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">Master Mode</a>.
				While this is equipped, the player will dodge the next attack as long as there have been no enemies within 15 tiles or <a is="a-link">bosses</a> within 45 tiles of the player for 6 seconds.
				If there are enemies within the designated radius and a current, incomplete charge is present, the charge will quickly decay.
				However, if the player has a full charge (indicated by the black hue, particle effects and red pupil), the effect can only be extinguished once the player makes contact with an enemy or hostile projectile, and must be charged again.
