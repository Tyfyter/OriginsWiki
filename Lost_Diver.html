						The Lost Diver swims through the brine while trying to keep level with you vertically.
						It also tries to have line of sight to the player when possible.
						When the Lost Diver is defeated, it transforms into the Mildew Carrion.<br/>
						The Mildew Carrion will move (WIP)

							(There seems to be a way for this attack to deal much more damage, but I am unsure how)

						 - The head inflicts Riven Assimilation at a severity of 8%, the body inflicts it at 6% and the tail inflicts it at 10% severity.
						 Similarly to their Assimilation amounts, the tail deals the most damage with the head coming in second and the body segments having the least.<br>
						 - The World Cracker recieves <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Knockback">knockback</a> from weapons that have a base damage of 100 or higher.<br>
						 - The World Cracker summons special versions of enemies commonly seen in the Riven Hive.
						 These versions have reduced stats in order to not be too much of a problem during its boss fight.

					<summary>Tips<span class="divider"></span></summary>
					<p>
						 - Prepare for swarms of enemies when attempting to fight the World Cracker.
						 You will be easily outnumbered for most of the fight, but can alleviate this problem by grouping enemies together such that piercing attacks can efficiently handle all of them at once.<br>
						 - Flying Exoskeletons are very troublesome to deal with, especially in higher difficulties as their speed is increased.
						 Focus on speed when Flying Exoskeletons are present as they inflict Riven Assimilation at a severity of 3% every hit, which can quickly add up.
