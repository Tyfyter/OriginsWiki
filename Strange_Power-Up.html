					 - "The very first sprite" tooltip is a reference to chrersis' first sprite ever made.
					 The Platformer Mech is a recreation of that sprite from memory, and is originally a part of her micro-game on <a is="a-link" href="https://www.whiteboardblog.co.uk/2016/03/sketch-nation-create-simple-game-design-app-kids/">Sketch Nation Create</a> called "Steel of War".<br> - The sound effect for the Platformer Mech spawning is inspired by the power-up collection noise from <a is="a-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechAssault">MechAssault</a> and was made with mouthy noises to recreate the feeling of its source.
