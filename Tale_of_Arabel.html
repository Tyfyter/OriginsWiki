				<p>The following is a short story of this mythos:</p>
				<p>"There are no winners in Arabel's story, no, only dismay. A mother who lost her only son and true love to calamity that befell her village. The Defiled beast had began ravaging already in that cold night. Even with the guard's calls, the villagers were still not ready for this disaster. The ample men ran to confront the beast after telling their loved ones to hide or run away, Arabel was no coward. She hid in the backyard, preparing her magic to bless the son. They both watched the father from afar as he began to become assimilated, his skin beginning to harden and crack to its influence. The son cried for his father, running naively towards his father blinded by his love for him. Arabel ran for the son, she was not going to lose him too… but she did. Her son and father conjoined into one lost, shattered body. She was too late and her rage rushed through her body like a violent concoction of burning oil. She used all her will and magic to end this madness. In her blind rage ripping the beast apart, she had gotten touched by the Defiled's wretched bile. The sudden shock of negative emotions flooding her mind broke her will and determination, causing her to flee. It seems the Defiled to this day has not taken her decisiveness, but it has taken away her hopes of ever being a sorceress ever again… for if she were to wield the power of mana ever again, the Defiled would finish consuming her body. The Defiled not only took away her magic but also her memories of her son and husband, using the chunks for its own necessity. Persistently, Arabel now wanders Terraria's vast lands in search for these memories."</p>

					Arabel was a sorceress in her village capable of wielding magic, but since the Defiled uses one's own mana as a catalyst for assimilation she is unable to channel mana without being further warped to the Defiled.
					Because of this, her body is only partly assimilated as she's been unable to find a remedy for it since it is kept away by the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad">Dryad</a>.
					As a consequence of being partly assimilated, chunks on her body have formed and are exchanged for other chunks whenever she draws close to the Defiled or one of its machinations as part of its way of life, but this caused important memories of her son and husband to be taken away from her.
					She is vengeful of this fact and is constantly in search of a means to end the Defiled for good.
