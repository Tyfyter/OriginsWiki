				The <b>Neural Network</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Guns.html">gun</a> that is currently obtained through the <a is="a-link">Broken Record</a> or craftable using <a is="a-link" href="Sanguinite_Bar.html">Sanguinite Bars</a> and <a is="a-link" href="NE-8.html">NE-8</a>.
				The Neural Network inflicts a <a is="a-link" href="Buffs.html">buff</a> to the player that causes its fire rate to increase after every consecutive hit.
				The buff will disappear after the player misses 4 of their shots in a row or when swapping to another weapon.
				Its icon can also be right-clicked in order to remove it, if the player desires to for whatever reason.
				Neural Network's base damage is lowered for every stack of the buff in order to offset its fire rate, however, it will always deal a higher overall DPS as its fire rate increases.
