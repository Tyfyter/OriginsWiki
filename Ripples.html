				<b>Ripples</b> are a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Game_mechanics">mechanic</a> added by the base game but used as kind-of stealth mechanic in Origins.
				Ripples are generated as you move through water, and are currently only used by <a is="a-link">enemies</a> found in the <a is="a-link">Brine Pool</a> as a way of detecting you.
				Ripples can be prevented by consuming a <a is="a-link">Skimswim Potion</a>.
