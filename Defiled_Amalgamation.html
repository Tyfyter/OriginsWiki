			<p>
				The <b>Defiled Amalgamation</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a>, <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Wastelands.html">Defiled</a>-themed <a is="a-link" href="Bosses.html">boss</a> having a bird-like, faintly-humanoid appearance with two large wings on its sides.
				It spawns off-screen nearby the player after destroying 3 <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Relay.html">Defiled Relays</a> or when the player uses a <a is="a-link">Nerve Impulse Manipulator</a> anywhere in the Wastelands.
				It will only spawn once the player reaches the surface.
			</p>

			<p>
				Defeating the Defiled Amalgamation and the <a is="a-link" href="Defiled_Swarmer.html">Defiled Swarmers</a> it summons are the only ways of obtaining <a is="a-link" href="Undead_Chunk.html">Undead Chunks</a>, and are one of the ways of obtaining usable quantities of <a is="a-link">Lost Ore</a> alongside the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a>.
				Defeating the Amalgamation for the first time also allows the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Tavernkeep">Tavernkeep</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a> to spawn as the Unconcious Man, and allows <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteorite_(biome)">meteorites</a> to land.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Defiled Amalgamation has multiple behaviors which can be pretty easily telegraphed by responsive players.
				The frequency of its behaviors are set to a counter where it performs a random behavior at every 300 count.
				It dashes at the player, utilizes its projectile spray and can regenerate health.
				These behaviors are explained in greater detail below.

					<summary>Behavior<span class="divider"></span></summary>

					<h3>Approach</h3>
					<p>
						 - Once 3 Defiled Relays have been smashed or a Nerve Impulse Manipulator has been used, the Defiled Amalgamation will spawn off-screen and rapidly approach at either a 2 o'clock or 10 o'clock position relative to the player depending on which direction it spawns from the player.
						Whenever the player gets just out of its reach in combat, it will position itself the same way.
					</p>
					<h3>Sidestep</h3>
					<p>
						 - The Amalgamation performs a sidestep randomly to swap between the aforementioned 2 o'clock and 10 o'clock positions.
						This behavior can also be used to dodge attacks or intercept the player.
					</p>
					<h3>Attacks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Dash Attack</strong> 
							 - The Amalgamation will attempt to hit the player with a fast dash.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Projectile Spray</strong> 
							 - The Amalgamation will spread its wings out to fire 6-8 projectile sprays that explode into 'defiled flak' whenever they are within proximity of the player, collide with a tile or reach the end of their duration.
							It will use this attack whenever the player is concealed in order to get the player out of hard-to-reach spots.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Beckoning Roar</strong> 
							 - The Amalgamation will spawn Defiled Swarmers when reaching half (every third in <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">Expert</a> and every quarter in <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">Master</a> respectively) of its health to overwhelm the player.
							The amount of Swarmers spawned increases with difficulty and the amount of players present in the world.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Burnout Attack</strong> 
							 - The Amalgamation's burnout attack involves an inital 3-dash frenzy in a set interval followed by a 7-second (6.42 seconds in Expert and 5.84 seconds in Master) rejuvenation period in which it will be immobile and vulnerable to attacks.
							The rejuvenation period increases its behavior count by 100/<a is=a-link class="expert" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">200</a>/<a is=a-link class="master" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">300</a> allowing it to perform any behavior other than another burnout attack shortly after.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Special</h3>
					<p>
						 - The Amalgamation additionally has a flat life regeneration divided by thresholds.
						These thresholds are present at every eighth (1/8) of its health (every sixth in Expert and every quarter in Master), and it will regenerate up to these thresholds until its health has been lowered past them.
						It regenerates at a rate of 8 life per second (10hp/s in Expert and 12hp/s in Master).

					<p>
						 - The Defiled Amalgamation will not spawn after smashing 3 Defiled Relays if the player reloads the world.<br>
						 - When considering fighting the Defiled Amalgamation, plan ahead and build a proper arena to be above or below it often with platforms laid out in multiple vertical layers.
						Be sure to be fast when it rejuvenates from a burnout attack to deal optimal damage.<br>
						 - Prepare for when it spawns after smashing the last Defiled Fissure as you will need to find your way back to the surface in order to strike it.
