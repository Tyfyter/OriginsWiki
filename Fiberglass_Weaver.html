					<p>
						The Fiberglass Weaver will perform many manuevers to get the jump on the player or put them in awkward situations using its thread.
						Movement speed is disencouraged when fighting the Weaver over calculated planning and strategy.
						Below are some of its attacks that it can perform.
					</p>

					<h3>Attacks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Lunge</strong> -
							The Fiberglass Weaver will charge up for a lunge at the player's current position if they get too far from it.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Thread Trap</strong> -
							The Fiberglass Weaver will spin up a thread trap that it uses to trap the player into a confined space.
							This attack can be telegraphed when the Weaver uses its front two legs in a spinning motion before finishing the attack.
							The threads deal high damage and knockback the player, leaving the only option to just avoid them outright.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Special</h3>
