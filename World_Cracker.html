				The <b>World Cracker</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Pre-Hardmode">pre-Hardmode</a>, <a is="a-link" href="Riven_Hive.html">Riven</a>-themed <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Worm_AI">worm</a> <a is="a-link" href="Bosses.html">boss</a>.
				It is summoned when three <a is="a-link" href="Gel_Blister.html">Gel Blisters</a> are destroyed in a Riven world, or when a player uses <a is="a-link">Suspicious Looking Ice Cream</a> anywhere in the Riven Hive or <a is="a-link">Underground Riven Hive</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The World Cracker has very simple attacks and mainly summons other minions to help it fight the player.
				It has a total of 15/<a is=a-link class="expert" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">17</a>/<a is=a-link class="master" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">19</a> segments including the head and tail, and it all counts as one unlike the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eater_of_Worlds">Eater of Worlds</a>.
				It will move opposite of the player making its movement unpredictable, but will charge at the player if they don't move.
				While moving around it will shoot amoeba bubbles, a laser beam or an amniotic sac that is used to summon enemies.
				Furthermore, the World Cracker has armor on all of its segments that reduce damage until it is destroyed.
			</p>

			<p>
				Defeating the World Cracker and destroying its armor are the only ways of obtaining <a is="a-link" href="Riven_Carapace.html">Riven Carapace</a>, and are one of the ways of obtaining usable quantities of <a is="a-link">Encrusted Ore</a> alongside the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a>.
				Defeating the World Cracker for the first time also allows the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Tavernkeep">Tavernkeep</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a> to spawn as the Unconcious Man, and allows <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Meteorite_(biome)">meteorites</a> to land.

					<p>
						It behaves like most worms except that it moves opposite of the player.
						If the player doesn't move, it will instead go for a direct strike.
						While moving it will perform any one of the attacks mentioned below.
					</p>

					<h3>Attacks</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Amoeba Bubble</strong> -
							The World Cracker will generate and fire amoeba bubbles in bursts from any one of its segments.
							The timing of this attack is explained thoroughly in the 'Difficulty Changes' section below.
							Each bubble inflicts <a is="a-link" href="Assimilation.html">Riven Assimilation</a> at a severity of 4%.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Frontal Beam</strong> -
							The World Cracker will fire a <a is="a-link">Seam Beam</a>-like laser out of its head in an attempt to cut the player off from where they are going.
							This attack deals great damage and inflicts 6% <a is="a-link" href="Assimilation.html">Riven Assimilation</a> every hit.
							A visual indicator of blue particles released from its head can be seen as it charges up for this attack.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Amniotic Sac</strong> -
							It will release a harmless amniotic sac containing a single or multiple enemies depending on what type of enemy is inside.
							The sac can be destroyed by the player prematurely to reduce the life of the enemies that are revealed from it.
							The enemy's health is directly tied to how long the sac has been released, but enemy health will never go below 5% of their max life.
							If the sac contains Amoeba Buggers, the amount of buggers released is also affected by this factor.
							Amniotic Sacs can release any of the following:<br>
							<a is="a-link">Amoeba Bugger</a> (as much as 4/<a is=a-link class="expert" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">5</a>/<a is=a-link class="master" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">6</a> per)<br>
							<a is="a-link">Amoebic Slime</a><br>
							<a is="a-link">Barnacleback</a><br>
							<a is="a-link">Flying Exoskeleton</a> (as much as 2 per)<br>
							<a is="a-link">Riven Protoform</a><br>
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Mitotic Diversion</strong> -
							After the World Cracker has sustained enough damage, it will release two amniotic sacs with Barnaclebacks to heal and boost it.
							It will perform this attack at 
						</li>

						<h3>Special</h3>
						<li>
							<strong>Marrowick Shell</strong> -
							The World Cracker has a tough marrowick shell encompassing all of its segments that reduces the damage dealt to it until it is destroyed.
							The armor of the head, body and tail segments each apply a different amount of defense that are all affected by the armor's health.
							Each armor piece has 150/<a is=a-link class="expert" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">200</a>/<a is=a-link class="master" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">250</a> health that it will add towards the World Cracker's total health.
							The head and body armor applies 100 defense while the tail applies 20.
							When body segment armor is destroyed, those segments will still have 8 defense.
							When the armor is destroyed there is a 33%/<a is=a-link class="expert" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Expert_Mode">67%</a>/<a is=a-link class="master" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Master_Mode">100%</a> chance for a stronger Flying Exoskeleton to appear in its wake to attack the player.
							At 50% of its max life, an armor piece will appear more broken, which is also reflected in the boss bar.

					<p>
						 - Prepare for swarms of enemies when attempting to fight the World Cracker.
						 You will be easily outnumbered for most of the fight, but can alleviate this problem by grouping enemies together such that piercing attacks can efficiently handle all of them at once.<br>
						 - Flying Exoskeletons are very troublesome to deal with, especially in higher difficulties as their speed is increased.
						 Focus on speed when Flying Exoskeletons are present as they inflict Riven Assimilation at a severity of 3% every hit which adds up.
