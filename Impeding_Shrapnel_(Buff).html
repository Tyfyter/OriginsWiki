				<b>Impeding Shrapnel</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="Debuffs.html">debuff</a> that is applied by most items and enemies found in the <a is="a-link">Ashen Factory</a>.
				When applied to an NPC that is slain afterwards, the enemy will release 5-7 frenzied shrapnel where it died that also inflict Impeding Shrapnel and deal damage.
				When applied to a player, they will instead be instantly killed if at or below 20% of their max <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Health">life</a>, however, if the player is above that threshold they will instead be inflicted with <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Bleeding">Bleeding</a>.
