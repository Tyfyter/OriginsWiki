				The <b>Indestructible Saddle</b> is a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Hardmode">Hardmode</a> <a is="a-link" href="Mounts.html">mount</a> that is sold by the <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Demolitionist">Demolitionist</a> <a is="a-link" href="NPCs.html">NPC</a> for <a-coins>1000000</a-coins> after giving 250 <a is="a-link">Peat Moss</a> to him once a <a is="a-link" href="https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Mechanical_bosses">mechanical boss</a> has been defeated.
				When activated, the player mounts a large missile that which they can control the vertical movement for by pressing the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> buttons.
				The missile will continously move at a great velocity until it comes into contact with an enemy or surface, or after its duration has expired.
				If the player collides with an obstruction that is not in the missile's way or if they crash into something with the missile, they will receive <a is="a-link" href="Self_Damage.html">self-damage</a> regardless of protection.
				If the player rides the missile until it expires while protected from self-damage, self-damage will be reduced accordingly.
			</p>

				Usage of the Indestructible Saddle applies a cooldown that is dependent on how long the player was using it, with full usage of it until it times out providing the smallest cooldown.
				Regardless of its cooldown, it is still one of the fastest modes of transport in Terraria.
